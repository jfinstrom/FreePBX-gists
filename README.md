FreePBX-gists
=============

Code snippets of different elements for use in FreePBX Development.  

This repository has code snippits for different items and tasks. none of the code here is meant to be independently functional. It should all be used within it's proper place in the FreePBX code. 

I made this repository to organize these snippits so they didn't get lost within my normal gists which are really random at times. 

This is more for personal use but you are free to use it as you develop within the license confines.

Happy Developing
